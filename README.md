## Applied Learning Assignment 2 â€“ Geospatial Data Analysis with QGIS
As part of my Geospatial Analysis journey, I explored the use of QGIS and open-source geospatial datasets to create meaningful insights.
## ðŸ”¹ Steps I carried out:
## Downloaded QGIS software â†’ qgis.org/download
## Retrieved population data from Geopode â†’ geopode.world/NGA
## Downloaded health facility data and Nigeria boundary data (State & LGA) from GRID3 â†’ grid3.org/geospatial-data-nigeria
## Collected settlement extent data from GRID3.
## Performed a spatial join of settlement extent with the LGA layer.
## Conducted an attribute join of the LGA layer with population data.
## Generated a population density map across all LGAs, symbolized into 7 classification ranges.
## Saved outputs for reuse â†’ spatial data as .sqlite and tabular data as .csv.
## ðŸ“Š Outcome:
From this project, one can visualize and analyze health facilities, population density, state and LGA boundaries, and settlement extent across Nigeriaâ€™s 36 states and regions.
GIS is a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making, especially in public health, urban planning, and sustainable development.
